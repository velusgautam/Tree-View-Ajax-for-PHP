# Tree-View-Ajax-for-PHP
A super fast tree view using java script and ajax with type on search of items at top and bottom listing the data in tree view.

It can be used in PHP, ASP.net or any language compatible with ajax.

A Sample DB with Data is added to the Database Folder
Database Configurations in Database/dbConfig.php File
